The Legend of Gabe:

- End Goal: Make  functioning legend of Zelda Rogulike with various kits that get picked up on every level based on how many kills the player gets. 
instead of a life system, there will be a coolness meter that goes down if hit and can only be increased by attacking and killing monsters. Players 
can use this coolness to buy new upgrades or save it to survive hits in the future. This will be a dungeon crawler with levels based on forest, cave,
colliseum, jungle, and a rest area called the dog park where the palyer can buy stuff.

- Game Mechanics: Coolness meter for health(when 0 you die), upgrades that change attacks or modify stats, rest area with a bunch of women 
monsters have wave attack patterns taht can be deflected by certain shields that the player can hold
